In my imagination, I invision people coming back though a portal, dirtied, out of breath and desperate looking; maybe even falling through and landing face down (as if falling though a doorway).  They all appear within close proximity to a direct ancestor who lives now (grand or great grandparent).  

They all come telling of the same story, of governments falling, cities burning, people dying, environmental destruction. They bring with them indisputable documentation of their claims and futuristic technology that we (the present humanity) will have decades or centuries to learn about and improve upon to defend ourselves from an invasion some day in the future.  History for the future people is devastated with technologies suddenly jumping forward decades/centuries and in ways that current society may not be prepared for (think of what it would be like if you handed someone from the 1800's a smartphone).  Governments can't classify the information or contain exposure as the general public is directly encountering their descendants on a massive scale."

- Nothing. Meet them and hope they are good folks. Greet them! 

- Dedicate 100% of our resources to military. Make earth into a fortress, send a back up away to preserve humanity.

- Accept defeat. Wait for them to arrive and kill us.

- Anything else?

What if we found clear evidence of an alien civilization... that we couldn't communicate with?,Quadell,76,12,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/FutureWhatIf/comments/177d67/what_if_we_found_clear_evidence_of_an_alien/,"Imagine SETI finds a clearly intelligent transmission from a distant star. (Let's say it isn't meant for us; it's just a byproduct of these aliens communicating with each other.) But the signal seems to come from a star 50,000 light years away, meaning it was generated 50,000 years ago. And if we responded, it wouldn't reach them for 50,000 years, possibly after both their civilization and ours were long gone. 

It's also a safe assumption that we would be unable to translate this message, since we have no points of reference to do so, and no information about the alien society to help us guess what it could mean.

Would this have any effect on humanity? Would it be the greatest discovery in history, proving that we're not alone? Or would it me just a meaningless jumble of bits that was ignored and largely forgotten after a brief time? What would the effect be?"

I created a hypothetical world map for the year 2100. Create a story!,mr_wiggin,81,20,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/FutureWhatIf/comments/1dc5fb/i_created_a_hypothetical_world_map_for_the_year/,"[Here's the map!](http://i.imgur.com/CPIsN0F.png)

I decided to rely heavily on what I know about current political unions, and upcoming unions.


In Asia, I imagine that Russia has balkanized due to rampant corruption and political in-fighting, with a fundamentalist Christian state forming around the Ural Mountains. China has lost some territory after the DPRK collapses, and Japan regained some of its former Empire. Earlier in the century, Mongolia discovered a treasure trove of mineral resources which jump started its economy. A South East Asian Union (ASEAN) emerges in response to China's territoriality. After a brief nuclear exchange in the 2030's, India claims Pakistan as part of its territory. Bangladesh unionizes with India after it receives heavy aid as a result of dramatic climate change ravaging the country.


In the Middle East, Iran remains the same geographically despite having gone through major social and political reform in the 2020's.The Central Asian Block is formed after Russia collapses, in response to political pressure from all sides. After decades of religious turmoil and sectarian violence, and partly in response to a dramatically more powerful Turkish Union, a Caliphate is created to run a Pan-Arabic Union. It started with the countries of the Arabic Peninsula, and slowly spreads through North Africa, and the rest of the Levant.

The EU has finally federalized after adding a few more countries and sorting out the financial crisis earlier in the century. The Scandinavian  Union forms purely due to their unique liberal social policies.

The East African Federation is formed in 2018. In the rest of Africa, after years of steady economic development and Chinese aid, other Unions are formed: The (Christian) Nigerian States of West Africa, and Greater South Africa.

In the Americas, South America federalized fairly early in the century, and has remained a prominent global power since. In response, the Caribbean States of America are formed out of Central America and the Caribbean. Mexico, over the years has seriously developed economically; even rivaling the United States and Canada. As a gesture of goodwill, and due to changing ethnic backgrounds of the American Southwest, Southern California (south of LA), Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas are ceded to Mexico.

It involves no collaborators to betray you or provide traceable communication. Planning (acquire gun &amp; ammunition, pick target) are activities with innocent explanations. It's hard to prove that a hunter or a mall shopper is planning a shooting spree attack. Someone messing around in the woods with explosives is a different matter.

What if Al Qaeda/Islamic fundamentalism stops focusing on ""complicated"" plots involving bombs and hijackings and instead urges folks on the path to radicalization to focus on much simpler ""mall shooter"" attacks.

The fact that such attacks are somewhat ""idiot proof"" (most attacks would result in at least some deaths) might make them appeal to a wider pool of potential jihadists. Let's assume that these attacks thus become very popular (several per week) and the ""terrorist attack"" rate increases while the ""terrorist plot detection rate"" plummets.

Furthermore, they predict that the demand for military intervention to protect US interests will increase *and* the quality of recruits available is falling due to fewer people joining the military and society in general becoming less physically and psychologically fit for combat.

The pentagon considers the situation and then finally decides to assign massive amounts of funding towards research into how they could create the very best infantry units that they possibly can. They decide to re-make the entire US army into a super-infantry force, scrapping all heavy armour and artillery units (or transferring them to the USMC).

What kind of super-soldiers are they likely to be able to get? Assume fairly 'realistic' advances in technology and social and legal restrictions on what you can reasonably do to human beings (so no raising people to fight from birth, no 90% casualty rates from training, et cetera) and no breakthroughs which allow non-humans (robots, engineered animals, synthetic lifeforms) to completely replace humans in the infantry role.

How would other countries without public healthcare deal with the massive ethical implications?
Would it become legal to preserve people *before* they died as it would no longer be considered homicide? I'm assuming people would want to be preserved but many may not, whether for religious reasons or otherwise. Would it even be ethically justifiable to pawn the sick of today off on future generations? Perhaps overcrowding and resource scarcity in the future will prevent them from being revived, even if we do eventually find cures for cancer etc.
